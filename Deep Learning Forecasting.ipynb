Inspect these first-cut estimates and use domain knowledge or domain experts to help improve these estimates so that they will be usefully correct on all data in the future.\n",
    "- Save descriptive statistics. You will need to normalize new data in the future in exactly the same way as the data used to train your model. Save the descriptive statistics used to file and load them later when you need to scale new data when making predictions.\n",
    "- Data Analysis. Use data analysis to help you better understand your data. For example, a simple histogram can help you quickly get a feeling for the distribution of quantities to see if standardization would make sense.\n",
    "- Scale Each Series. If your problem has multiple series, treat each as a separate variable and in turn scale them separately.\n",
    "- Scale At The Right Time. It is important to apply any scaling transforms at the right time. For example, if you have a series of quantities that is non-stationary, it may be appropriate to **scale after first making your data stationary**. It would not be appropriate to scale the series after it has been transformed into a supervised learning problem as each column would be handled differently, which would be incorrect.\n",
